Got it ✅ — here’s a **comprehensive README** you can drop directly into your project root (`agrimind-x/README.md`).
It’s structured to impress hackathon judges **and** help your team get started quickly.

# 🌾 AgriMind-X — Multimodal Multi-Agent AI for Next-Gen Agriculture

AgriMind-X is a **multimodal, multi-agent AI platform** designed to autonomously manage key aspects of agriculture: irrigation, crop health, financial access, market forecasting, and sustainability tracking.

It is built as a **hackathon-ready starter kit** with:

* **FastAPI backend** (agents, routes, mock logic, event logging)
* **React Native frontend skeleton** (mobile-first, farmer-friendly UI)
* **Sample agricultural datasets** (soil moisture, market prices, weather, subsidy docs)
* **Mermaid diagrams** (system architecture, UX flow, impact visualization)

This project is optimized to meet **Capital One Hackathon judging criteria**:

* **Innovation** (multi-agent + multimodal)
* **Finance Integration** (OCR + auto-loans/subsidies)
* **Accuracy & Feasibility** (mock models with real datasets)
* **Hyperlocal Solutions** (tuned for paddy in Assam as example)
* **AI Alignment** (consent, explainability, overrides)

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🤖 Agents

* **IrrigAI** → Decides irrigation based on soil moisture & rainfall forecast.
* **PestGuard** → Detects diseases/deficiencies from crop leaf images (mock classifier).
* **FinanceFlow** → Extracts data from subsidy/loan forms via OCR & auto-fills applications.
* **MarketBrain** → Predicts market trends and suggests “Sell/Hold” actions.
* **EcoTrack** → Estimates water savings & carbon footprint from AI-driven actions.
SoilSense Agent – Monitors soil health & advises on fertilization

### 🧠 Multimodality

* **Vision** (images): Detect crop disease.
* **Speech** (voice input): Ask questions in English/Hindi.
* **Text/OCR**: Extract fields from subsidy/loan documents.
* **Sensors**: Soil & weather data (mocked for demo).
* **Data Feeds**: Market prices & forecasts.

## ⚡ Quickstart

### Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

API will be live at: **[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)**

### Frontend (React Native)

* Scaffold with Expo or RN CLI.
* Copy `frontend/` files into your project.
* Set `API_BASE` to your backend URL.

### Docker (optional)

```bash
cd infra
docker-compose up --build
```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Endpoint                | Description                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /infer/pestguard` | Upload crop image → detect disease/deficiency |
| `POST /decide/irrigai`  | Soil & rain data → irrigation decision        |
| `POST /ocr/financeflow` | Upload subsidy doc → extract fields           |
| `POST /finance/submit`  | Submit loan/insurance request (mock)          |
| `GET  /market/forecast` | Get “Sell/Hold” recommendation                |
| `GET  /events/recent`   | Event log of recent agent actions             |

---

## 📊 Sample Data

* **Soil CSV** → Simulated hourly soil moisture.
* **Market Prices CSV** → Daily price data for paddy.
* **Weather Forecast JSON** → Mock 48h rainfall prediction.
* **Finance Note TXT** → Sample subsidy/loan form text.

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

* **Adoption Rate** (% farmers using app).
* **Yield Improvement** (% crop gain vs baseline).
* **Financial Access** (# of loan/insurance applications auto-completed).
* **Resource Savings** (liters of water saved per acre).
* **Prediction Accuracy** (disease/price forecast confidence).
* **Sustainability Impact** (carbon reduction estimate).

---

## 🛡️ AI Alignment & Safety

* **Consent Gate** → Farmer must approve before finance/market actions.
* **Explainable Outputs** → Each decision has a “Why?” explanation.
* **Confidence Thresholds** → Low-confidence results suggest consulting an expert.
* **Privacy** → Sensitive IDs redacted on-device before submission.
* **Fairness** → Same inputs yield same outputs regardless of farmer profile.

## 📅 Hackathon Demo Flow (8 min)

1. **Voice Input (Hindi/English)** → “Kab paani dena hai?” → IrrigAI reply.
2. **Image Upload** → PestGuard detects disease + treatment.
3. **Doc Scan** → FinanceFlow extracts fields, auto-fills form.
4. **Market Forecast** → MarketBrain advises “Sell 30% tomorrow”.
5. **Dashboard** → Events log with impact metrics.
6. **Alignment** → Show consent, override, and explanations.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Integrate **real IoT hardware sensors**.
* Fine-tune disease models on **local crop datasets**.
* Add **real-time financial APIs** for microloans & insurance.
* Expand multilingual voice interaction.
* Blockchain-based traceability for **supply chain transparency**.

👉 This README is crafted to **guide your hackathon demo AND impress the judges** by clearly showing innovation, feasibility, and scalability.

Do you want me to also write a **shorter README.md for the frontend only**, so the React Native part looks polished too?
